# Monthly Volume Profile Structure

This profile structure provides clear evidence of where smart money has been positioned and where future price reactions are most probable.

## Left Side - Tick Profile:

The tick profile reveals significant accumulation in the lower price ranges, with heavy density indicating substantial time spent at these levels. This suggests strong institutional interest and support building in this zone, which corresponds to your marked major support activity. The concentration of trading time demonstrates that market participants have found value at these prices.


## Right Side - Volume Profile:

The volume profile shows two distinct high-volume nodes that define the current market structure:

### Lower Volume Node (Support Zone):
 This area represents a significant value area where buyers have been actively accumulating positions. The substantial volume concentration indicates this is a well-established support zone with strong buyer interest and institutional participation.
### Upper Volume Node (Resistance Zone): 
 This area demonstrates heavy trading activity and appears to be acting as resistance where selling pressure increases, likely representing profit-taking or institutional distribution.

## Conclusion

#### Support Analysis:
The lower marked zone shows classic support characteristics with high volume density and extended time spent at these prices. The tick profile concentration suggests this area has been thoroughly tested and validated by market participants, indicating strong buyer conviction.

#### Resistance Analysis:
The upper marked zone demonstrates typical resistance behavior with increased selling activity. The market structure shows this level has been a significant barrier to further upward movement.

#### Market Structure:
The gap between the two major volume nodes represents a low-volume area that could see rapid price movement if breached. This thin trading zone suggests limited resistance or support between the two major activity areas.
